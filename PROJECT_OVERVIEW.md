# PG Rental System - Project Overview

## 🎯 What is this project?

The PG Rental Management System is a web-based platform that digitalizes the process of finding and managing Paying Guest (PG) accommodations. It connects property owners with potential tenants, streamlining room bookings, payments, and tenant management.

Think of it as an "Airbnb for PG accommodations" with integrated payment processing and tenant management features.

## 🔑 Key Components

- Tenants can browse available PG rooms
- View details like rent, capacity, amenities
- Check real-time availability

### 2. **Booking System**
- Simple 3-step application form
- Instant submission to property owners
- Application tracking with status updates

### 3. **Payment Gateway**
- Multiple payment options (UPI, Cards, Net Banking, Cash)
- Secure transaction processing
- Payment history and receipt generation

### 4. **User Profiles**
- Personal dashboard for tenants
- Booking history tracking
- Payment management

## 🏗️ How It Works
